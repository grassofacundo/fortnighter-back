I think a good idea to clean up the unused sessions in the DB would be to delete all sessions with more than a year of date
creation. Because their tokens would be expired by then, they only last a year, after that, they will need to log in again and
create a new session.


Tax and bonus guide:

For every worked [shifts], I [got paid/have to pay], [number] [dollar/percentage] {IF PERCENTAGE of my daily gain}.

"For every 1 worked shift, I have to pay 10% of the daily gain"
"For every 5 worked shifts, I got paid 70$"
"For every 1 worked shifts, I got paid 5% of the daily gain"

For this payment only, I [got paid/have to pay], [number] [dollar/percentage] {IF PERCENTAGE of my total gain}.

"For this payment only, I got paid $200"
"For this payment only, I have to pay 30% of my total gain"
"For this payment only, I got paid 50% of my total gain"

If my [daily gain/total gain] is [more/less] than [Number]. I [got paid/have to pay], [number] [dollar/percentage] {
IF PERCENTAGE of my daily gain}

"If my daily gain is more than $300. I have to pay 10% of my daily gain."
"If my daily gain is less than $100. I got paid $50"
"If my total gain is more than $5000. I have to pay 25% of my total gain."
